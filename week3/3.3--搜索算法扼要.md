# 3.3--搜索算法扼要

现在我们简明地重述搜索算法．我们见过了不用任何专业知识的盲目搜索(uninformed search) .

应用盲目搜索的方法包括BFS,广度优先搜索;
DFS,深度优先搜索; DLS, 深度受限搜索;
IDS, 迭代加深搜索; and UCS, 均匀代价搜索(Uniform-Cost Search).
我们也学习了informed search．它运用了估算我们离目标有多近的启发函数．
这类方法包括 贪婪搜索, A*搜索,
和 IDA* 搜索（见homework）.
It's basically an IDS using the A* trick of using
the heuristic.
To fix the IDA, let's talk again about DFS
and how it looks on the tree.
DFS is the tree branch by branch,
这是说我们将探索每一个分支，一直到我们到达树的最大深度．
[We're going to explore this first branch in green,
then the second branch, which would actually
be the second sibling of this node here,
then the third branch, the fourth branch,
the fifth branch, et cetera, et cetera. ]

边缘(fringe/frontier)的定义：包含接下来要访问的结点们的数据结构．

在这里，它包含所有祖先的未探测的同胞们．
[So when you explore this node here--
going to put both of these nodes in the fringe. ]

You explore this one, this remains in the fringe.
But you are exploring these nodes here.
So we're going to explore these two nodes.
You add these two in the fringe.
But we explore this one first.
So all of this remain in the fringe until they are explored.

最终, you're going to handle--
need to put these members in the fringe.
And whenever you finish a path, you
need to go back and pull things from the fringe, pop things
from the fringe to be explored next.
因此，这个搜索行进的方式是：一次走尽一个分支.



## IDS

与DFS不同的是, IDS 将 一个子树一个子树地搜索，而不是一个分支一个分支地搜索．这里每一个子树将增加其深度极限. 首先，我们将有深度为0的树. 我们在其上执行DFS.　接下来我们有深度为1的树，我们也在其上执行DFS.
然后，深度为２,3,4等等. 

So we're going to explore this way.
So thinking about each iteration is simply
an instance of depth-limited search
where the search proceeds by exhausting
larger and larger subtrees.
我们要做的是展开那棵树．一旦达到我们设定的深度极限，我们将停止搜索．


## BFS

记住, BFS 一层一层地搜索．这里的层，就是结点深度的意思．
因此，你将探索第一层，第二层，第三层，等等.
And observe that as we go, we are
going to put all these elements, these nodes in gray,
in the fringe, which means that these
will be next to be explored.
And you wouldn't go to the next level
unless we really have explored-- we don't go here
unless we have explored all the nodes in this level.
So we keep going.
And the fringe here or the frontier
consists of the nodes of similar depth of the horizontal line
here.

So initially, we have the two elements in the fringe.
When we move to the next layer, we
have these elements in the fringe, et cetera.

## UCS

UCS (uniform-cost search)也是一层一层地搜索. 但与BFS不同的是, UCS将由path cost来组织，而不是结点深度.
So we're going to have elements explored all over the place in the tree privatized by the costs
till the node. It could be, for example, this kind of search.
But observe, again, that the gray nodes
correspond to the element that are in the fringe.
So how about the fringe?
The fringe or the frontier consist
of the nodes of various depth.
它有点参差不齐. 主要原因是：低成本优先.
So it's to be this fringe and then this one.
Depending on how we are exploring the tree,
we are going to pick from here and there depending
on the cost of this node.
So it's going to be jagged.
So let's do it again.

[So as comparison to the BFS that does this search layer
by layer, the layers in this case
are rather picked by the cost.]

So it's going to be something--
layer by layer, but quite jagged in the search.
Interestingly, we can organize these algorithms
into pairs, where the first element of the pair
沿层行进 and the second element of the pair沿子树行进.
So for example, if we iterate on node depth,
then BFS will search 层们 of increasing node depth
while IDS will search 子树们 of increasing node depth.
So [INAUDIBLE] going to be for BFS doing this,
while IDS actually will do this.
That's the first tree.
Then it makes the tree bigger.
And then it goes bigger, et cetera.
If we iterate on path cost plus heuristic function--
记住, we use the function f.
函数f 用于启发式搜索.
$$
f(n) = g(n) + h(n).
$$


So the h是启发函数(heuristic),　g 是到底该结点的成本.
So this time, we search layers of increasing path
costs plus heuristic search--即f.

And IDA-star, 是 A-star 算法的变体,它运用了IDS算法,
(迭代深度搜索), searches subtrees of increasing
path cost plus heuristic, which is also f.

最后, 强调一下什么方法用何种函数.
例如，对于 UCS, Uniform Cost Search,
它一层一层地搜索 (of increasing path cost).
So it's going to work on the function using the function
g to pick which nodes to explore and pick those
that have the smallest cost.
Greedy best first搜索 搜索layers of increasing heuristic function,
且其启发函数为h.
 A* 搜索法 搜索layers of increasing both path
cost, g, 加上启发函数 h.
So it's going to be the function f＝g+h. 那是从根到该结点的路径加上从该结点到目标点的启发函数或估算的成本.
