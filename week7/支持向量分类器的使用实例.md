# 机器学习(三): 支持向量机分类器　实例　

## 导言

​	SVMs (Support Vector Machines) are a useful technique for data classification. Although
SVM is considered easier to use than Neural Networks, users not familiar with
it often get unsatisfactory results at first. Here we outline a “cookbook” approach
which usually gives reasonable results.
Note that this guide is not for SVM researchers nor do we guarantee you will
achieve the highest accuracy. Also, we do not intend to solve challenging or diffi-
cult problems. Our purpose is to give SVM novices a recipe for rapidly obtaining
acceptable results.
Although users do not need to understand the underlying theory behind SVM, we
briefly introduce the basics necessary for explaining our procedure. 　A classification
task usually involves 将数据集分为training and testing sets. Each instance
in the training set contains one “target value” (即类别标签)和几个特征(
“attributes”) (即属性，测量值). SVM的目标: 产生一个模型 (based on the training data) which predicts the target values of the test data
given only the test data attributes.
Given a training set of instance-label pairs (xi
, yi), i = 1, . . . , l where xi ∈ Rn and
y ∈ {1, −1}
l
, the support vector machines (SVM) (Boser et al., 1992; Cortes and
Vapnik, 1995) require the solution of the following optimization problem:
