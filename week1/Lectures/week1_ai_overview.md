## Week 1.  AI overview

欢迎来到AI 课程.

此课程中，我们将概述AI 是什么(what)?

为何要学习AI?

AI历史上的重要人物和事件是什么？

和AI应用相关的重要人物是谁？



我们也概述本课程的结构．



## 什么是人工智能？

首先, AI总能成功地激起人们的兴趣.

已经成功地成为了电视和电影的主题长达数十年之久.

例如, 利用计算机做自然语言转换一直以来都是人类的梦想.

电影, 如 21世纪太空漫游(space Odyssey).

AI is actually an active and attractive field for

the movie making industry in many ways.

It is the perfect kind of topic to craft thrillers, adventures and dramas.

And keep people on the edge of their sofa.

Remember Terminator, AI, Her, Space Odyssey and

HAL, Ex machina and so on and so forth.

There have been several attempts to define artificial intelligence.

But let's start with the most basic definition of *intelligence,*

according to the Webster dictionary.

It's **the ability to learn and solve problems**.

This is a definition independently of whether it's Human intelligence or

machine intelligence.

Artificial intelligence, according to Wikipedia,

is the intelligence exhibited by *machines or software*.

We're being more specific here, and talking about machines and

software that show signs of intelligence.

More specifically, according to McCarthy, who is one of the pioneer of artificial

intelligence, and who even coined the term AI.

It's the *science and engineering of making intelligent machines*.

And finally, the definition we adopt in this course is coming from Russell and

Norvig the authors of the famous artificial intelligence book.

**Artificial intelligence is the study and design of intelligence agents**

**where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives it's environment and**

**takes actions that maximizes its chances of success.**

This is the most specific definition of all, in which we are talking about

intelligence agents and the fact that they perceive their **environment** and

act upon that environment to maximize their chances of success.

This is a definition that we will adopt in this course.



## 为什么学习人工智能？

为什么学习AI?

 **Andrew Ng**说：正如工业革命将人类从大量体力劳动中解放出来，**AI 有能力将人类从大量脑力苦力劳动中释放**.

什么是AI?

***There's four schools of thought***, according to Russell and Norvig.

The first one is about ***thinking humanly***. In which, several researchers defined it as, how to make computers have a mind, or think.

One of them is Haugeland in 1985 who said that it is the exciting new efforts to make computers think.

Machines with minds in the full and literal sense.



The second school of thought is about ***acting humanly*** as defined by Rich and Knight in 1991.

As the study of how to make computers do things, which at the moment people are better at.



The third school of thought is about ***thinking rationally*** in which we want to

study the mental faculties through the use of computational models.

So we started talking about computational models to mimic the brain or

mimic our mental faculties.



And finally, the last school of thought is about ***acting rationally*** as defined by Poole et al. in 1998.

Which is, computational intelligence is the study and

the design of intelligent agents.

So we start talking about intelligent agents in 98, in which we want to design those systems.

We don't talk any more about making the machine have a mind or

making the machine think rationally, or making the machine act humanly.

We want the machine to *act rationally* rather than *humanly*.



## 细说四种观念

So first of all, let's go through this schools of thought individually.

The first school is about thinking humanly.

Also called the cognitive approach in which we want to design machines, with what?

With minds, machines that think in the full and literal sense.

This requires first to determine how humans think.

It was actually in the 60s when this kind of cognitive revolution started.

It requires scientific theories of internal activities of the brain,

answer questions like what level of abstractions.

Is it knowledge or circuits and how to validate the knowledge.

Today, cognitive science and artificial intelligence are distinct disciplines and

we really don't want to have machines with minds.

We want to understand how brains function.

This is part of the cognitive science field.



第二种school of thought是关于*acting humanly*.

在这种思想里,我们想拥有能像人一样做事情的机器.

这种school of thought, 源于**Alan Turing** (1950).

当他发表他的论文*Computing Machinery and Intelligence*, (在此文章中，他定义了现在称为Turing Test的概念, 有时这个概念也称为Imitation Game.

在他的测试中，他实际上deem 一台计算机to be passing a test of intelligence if it can fool a human interrogator.  So to picture this, we have a human interrogator on one side and there is

wall separating this human interrogator from another human and another AI system.

So the human interrogator would be asking questions to the other side of the wall.

And 这个AI系统 would be deemed as intelligent 如果the human interrogator不能区分AI系统和人类．

So it says that it fooled the human interrogator(质问者) and it showed to 展示出某种形式的智能.

在这篇文章中, Turing还建议AI的主要成分，包括知识，推理，语言理解和学习.

最后，他对这些问题中的很多个都进行研究, or

many arguments against AI that's coming up in the next 50 years.

像人一样行动或制造机器来做事情已经激发出了许多发现,其中包括飞行.



我们知鸟儿能飞行，因此飞行这一概念已经被证实！我们知道飞行是可能的，但是飞行过程是被人类发明出来的．

And we don't see airplanes flapping their wings :),

however airplanes use similar, have the same effect of flying using different

principles including aerodynamics processes, 等等

因此，像人一样行动已经激发了很多新发现，even though the process at

the end has been different from what we observe in nature.



第三个school of thought称为***thinking rationally*,** or

laws of thoughts, 包括运用数学和逻辑来做人工智能.

It's about codifying the right thinking利用逻辑.

这一思想来源于数个发展出了各种形式的逻辑希腊学校.

例如一阶逻辑，命题逻辑等等.

It uses some notations and rules of inference or derivations for thoughts.

And the idea is to use/codify all knowledge in this representation and

use it to derive new knowledge.

The problems with this,

is that first of all not all knowledge can be expressed with logical formulations.

Sometimes, for example, to express time or space.

It's hard and can lead to complicated logical formulas for that.

And finally, it also leads to computational blow up,

if you want to consider all possible factors that come into play with logic.

If you want to use all possible factors that come into play with logic.



最后，最后一个school of thought 是关于***acting rationally，***

设计智能系统that　act to 最大化其目标.

AI是关于做正确的事情的智能体的学问, that which is actually expected to

maximize the goal achievement giving the available information about

the environment, the background knowledge, etc.

我们想设计in this school of thought rational 智能体,

that is actually one that acts to achieve the best outcome and

when there is 一个随机环境(不确定性).

想达到最好的期待结果 given these agents.

Aristotle曾说："每一种艺术and every inquiry, 以及每一个行动和追求, is thought to aim at some good.

这正是其精神of this school of thoughts 于设计智能体．



Finally, 本课程中,我们将采取第四种思想(**acting rationally** ) --理性地行动．

Or how to divide intelligence systems that act rationally in order to achieve

their goals.
