### **I. Introduction**

An instance of the 2048-puzzle game is played on a **4×4 grid**, with　带数字的方块 .　当游戏者移动（4个方向）方块时，它们可以同时往一个方向上滑动. 每移动一次， 一个新的方块会随机地在方格盘上的某个空位产生，其值要么是2,要么是4. Per the input direction given by the player, all tiles on the grid slide as far as possible in that direction, until they either (1) collide with another tile, or (2) collide with the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a single tile, valued at the sum of the two original tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move.

In the first assignment, you had ample experience with the process of abstracting ideas and 设计多个函数, 多个类, and 多个数据结构.　彼时，其目标是为了熟悉objects, states, nodes, functions,以及 implicit 或 explicit search trees 的实现方式和它们在实践中的相互作用． 现在,　我们关注的焦点是strictly on 算法之底层细节. 　所有的框架代码都会给你，以便你开始此项目.　你只需要集中精力与优化你的算法.

With typical像国际象棋一样的棋盘游戏, 游戏中的两个玩家  (i.e. "Computer AI" and the "Player")轮流做类似的操作, 且有相似的目标．在2048-谜题游戏中, 玩家的地位确是非对称的: 计算机和游戏者所需要做的操作差异巨大. 具体地,　计算机负责随机地放置2或者4在棋盘上的空白方格中,而游戏者则负责移动这些带数字的方块.　然而，对抗搜索照样可以应用到这个游戏.

### **II. 算法概述**

在你开始之前, 回顾一下讲义关于对抗搜索的内容.　这是一个零和游戏吗? minimax 原理是什么? 在2048-谜题游戏中, 技术上说，计算机AI不是对抗性的("adversarial"). 尤其, 它做的一切就是: 每次轮到它时，spawn random tiles of 2 and 4 (用事先设计好的几率要么2，要么 4); 计算机肯定不会specifically将拼贴故意放置在不合适的位置来愚弄游戏者，干扰其进度. 然而，我们将创建一个 " AI玩家" ，以致于表现得计算机像是完全对抗的一样. 具体地, 在本项目中，我们将采用**minimax 算法** .

注意, 在 game-playing 我们通常选择一个策略 **strategy** 来应用. With the minimax algorithm, 该策略假设:　在最小化游戏者的结果这一点上，计算机对手是完美的. Whether or not the opponent is actually perfect in doing so is another question. 作为一个一般的原理, how far the actual opponent's actual behavior deviates from the assumption certainly affects how well the AI performs [**1**].　然而, 你将看到: 这个策略在该游戏中运行良好. 在该项目中,我们将实现和优化这个minimax算法.

[**1**] As we saw in the case of a simple game of tic-tac-toe,采用 the minimax算法很有用．　该算法假设对手是一个完美的最小化("minimizing"）智能体. 实际上, 我们可能遇到并非完美的对手(**sub-par opponent**）--它可能做出愚蠢的移动. When this happens, the algorithm's assumption deviates from the actual opponent's behavior. In this case, it still leads to the desired outcome of never losing. However, if the deviation goes the other way (e.g. suppose we employ a "maximax" algorithm that assumes that the opponent wants us to win), then the outcome would certainly be different.

### **III. Using The Skeleton Code**

为了让你集中精力于算法之细节，我们为你提供了一个框架代码以助你开始,且允许你自己测试你的算法 and to allow you to test your algorithm on your own. The skeleton code includes the following files. Note that you will only be working in **one** of them, and the rest of them are read-only:

- - - **Read-only**: GameManager.py. This is the driver program that loads your Computer AI and Player AI, and begins a game where they compete with each other. See below on how to execute this program.
    - **Read-only**: Grid.py. This module defines the Grid object, along with some useful operations: move(), getAvailableCells(), insertTile(), andclone(), which you may use in your code. These are available to get you started, but they are by no means the most efficient methods available. If you wish to strive for better performance, feel free to ignore these and write your own helper methods in a separate file.
    - **Read-only**: BaseAI.py. This is the base class for any AI component. All AIs inherit from this module, and implement the getMove() function, which takes a Grid object as parameter and returns a move (there are different "moves" for different AIs).
    - **Read-only**: ComputerAI.py. This inherits from BaseAI. The getMove() function returns a computer action that is a tuple (x, y) indicating the place you want to place a tile.
    - **Writable**: PlayerAI.py. You will create this file, and this is where you will be doing your work. This 应该继承自BaseAI. ThegetMove() function, which you will need to implement, returns a number that indicates the player’s action. 具体地, 0 表示 "Up", 1 表示 "Down", 2表示"Left", 3表示 "Right". 需要创建这个文件，并使其尽可能地智能化. 可以上传其他文件, 但它们都必须包括在此文件之中.
    - **Read-only**: BaseDisplayer.py and Displayer.py. These print the grid.

.

To test your code, execute the game manager like so:

$ python GameManager_3.py

The progress of the game will be displayed on your terminal screen, with one snapshot printed after each move that the Computer AI or Player AI makes. The Player AI is allowed **0.2 seconds** to come up with each move. The process continues until the game is over; that is, until no further legal moves can be made. At the end of the game, the **maximum tile value** on the board is printed.

**IMPORTANT**: 不要去修改标识为只读的那些文件. When your submission is graded, the grader will first automatically **over-write** all read-only files in the directory before executing your code. This is to ensure that all students are using the same game-play mechanism and computer opponent, and that you cannot "work around" the skeleton program and manually output a high score.

### **IV. What You Need To Submit**

Your job in this assignment is to write PlayerAI.py, which intelligently plays the 2048-puzzle game. Here is a snippet of **starter code** to allow you to observe how the game looks when it is played out. In the following "naive" Player AI. The getMove() function simply selects a next move in random out of the available moves:

`from random import randint`

`from BaseAI import BaseAI`

` `

`class PlayerAI(BaseAI):`

`def getMove(self, grid):`

　 `moves = grid.getAvailableMoves()`

​      return moves[randint(0, len(moves) - 1)] if moves else None`

显然, 这个确实是玩2048谜题的一个非常简陋的方式. If you submit this as your finished product, you will likely receive a grade of zero. You should implement your Player AI with the following points in mind:

- - - 应用**minimax algorithm**. 这是必须的. 有许多不同的策略来赢得2048-谜题, 但在此作业中，我们要练习应用the minimax algorithm.
    - 实现 **alpha-beta pruning**. 这是必须的. 剪枝可以消除不相干的分支，从而加速搜索过程. In this case, is there anything we can do about move ordering?
    - 应用**heuristic functions**. 这个游戏树的最大高度是多少? 不像诸如tic-tac-toe这样的简单游戏, 本游戏中，想搜索整个理论上的游戏树的深度，是非常不现实的. 为了能截断你的搜索于某点, 你必须应用**heuristic functions** 来允许你分配近似值给树中的结点. 记住, 每次移动的时间上限是0.2秒,因此在时间截止前你必须实现一个系统的方法截断你的搜索.
    - 配置**heuristic weights**. 你将可能想包含多于一个启发函数. 在那种情况下, 你将需要分配权重给每一个启发函数. Deciding on an appropriate set of weights will take careful reasoning, along with careful experimentation. If you feel adventurous, you can also simply write an optimization meta-algorithm to iterate over the space of weight vectors, until you arrive at results that you are happy enough with.

### **V. Important Information**

Please read the following information carefully. Before you post a clarifying question on the discussion board, make sure that your question is not already answered in the following sections.

**1. Note on Python 3**

.

Each file in the skeleton code actually comes in **two flavors**: [filename].py (written in Python 2) and [filename]_3.py (written in Python 3). If you prefer to develop in Python 3, you will be using the latter version of each file in the skeleton code provided. **In addition, you will have to name your player AI file** **PlayerAI_3.py** **as well, so that the grader will be alerted to use the correct version of Python during grading.** For grading purposes, please only submit one of the following, but not both:

- - - PlayerAI.py (developed in Python 2, and relying on the Python 2 version of each skeleton code file), or
    - PlayerAI_3.py (developed in Python 3, and relying on the Python 3 version of each skeleton code file).

If you submit both versions, the grader will only grade one of them, which probably not what you would want. To test your algorithm in Python 3, execute the game manager like so:

$ python3 GameManager_3.py

**2. Basic Requirements**

Your submission **must** fulfill the following requirements:

- - - - 你必须使用对抗搜索于 PlayerAI (minimax with alpha-beta pruning).
      - You must provide your move within the time limit of 0.2 seconds.
      - You must name your file PlayerAI.py (Python 2) or PlayerAI_3.py (Python 3).
      - Your grade will depend on the maximum tile values your program usually gets to.

**3. Grading Submissions**

Grading is exceptionally straightforward for this project: **the better your Player AI performs, the higher your grade.** While this is straightforward, we admit that this Adversarial Search project is the most difficult project in this class because of its open-endedness. Your Player AI will be pitted against the standard Computer AI for a total of **10 games**, and the **maximum tile value** of each game will be recorded. Among the 10 runs, we pick and average **top 5** maximum tile values. Based on the average of these 5 maximum tile values, your submission will be assessed out of a total of **100 points**.

- - - - Submissions that are no better than **random** will receive a score of zero.
      - **Submissions which contains two 1024 runs and three 2048 runs will** **receive full credit.** For example, [256, 512, 512, 512, 1024, 1024, 1024, 2048, 2048, 2048] will receive full credit.
      - Submissions that fall somewhere in between will receive partial credit on a **logarithmic** scale. That is, every time you manage to double your average maximum tile value, you will be moving your final grade up in equally-spaced notches (instead of doubling as well). For other credit examples, please see Week 4 Project FAQs.

### **VI. Before You Submit**

- **Make sure** your code executes without fail on Vocareum. In particular, make sure you name your file correctly according to the instructions specified above, especially regarding different Python versions.
- **Make sure** your player achieves a satisfactory score on Vocareum. Your submission will be graded on the platform, where you may be allocated more or less processing power than your personal computer.
- **Make sure** your PlayerAI.py does not print anything to the screen on Vocareum. Printing gameplay progress is handled by Grid.py, and there should ideally be nothing else printed. Due to the resource-intensive nature of this assignment, there is a limit on the throughput for each user's terminal on the platform. If you exceed the limit by printing more characters than it can handle, your process may get killed while the game is in progress, which would cause problems while grading.
- **You get unlimited submissions. There is a 30-minute time restriction in between submissions**. By hitting the "**SUBMIT**" button on Vocareum, you are committing your work as the final product, and no further changes in your code will be considered. Depending on the grading load of the platform and the effectiveness of your code, it may take up to a day for your work to be graded completely.
  We are allowing several attempts at submitting your final work product. This is intended to accommodate for silly mistakes or accidents, or if you suddenly discover a novel way to improve your original algorithm and averaged scores after your initial submission. However, **please test your code extensively before you submit.**
